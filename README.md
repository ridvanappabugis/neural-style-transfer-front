# Neural Style Transer Client
Companion project to the ml project for Neural Style Transfer https://github.com/ridvanappabugis/style-back.

Written in React, contains a client used to browse artworks/upload images that will be used as content/style image inputs for the Neural Style Transfer logic.

# Run
Build with ```npm build```. Run with ```npm start```.

# Choose Art from WikiArt Or Upload your own images

This client integrates with the free, academic-licensed API from WikiArt.org, in order for the client to be able to browse artwork without the need to upload it manually. 

<b>WikiArt</b> provides a read-only API to obtain information about artists and paintings. Authenticate with API Key/secret and obtain JSON responses with updated artists, deleted artists, artists by a dictionary, updated dictionaries, dictionaries by group, most viewed paintings, paintings by artist, and painting search. WikiArt is a visual encyclopedia.

Documentation for this API can be found here:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T926unU7mx9Blmx3c8UE0UQTnO3MrDbXTGYVerVQFDU/edit#

As well as choosing web based artwork, user can upload images as well and choose them for styling.
